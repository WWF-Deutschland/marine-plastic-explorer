  Mismanaged plastic waste entering our environment is a growing global concern.
  Wind and rain carry it into our rivers and out to sea where it endangers
  wildlife and accumulates in the food chain.

Mismanaged waste can be the result of personal littering, illegal dumping and poorly designed waste management systems and processes. 

Mismanaged plastic waste generation is highest in areas of poor waste management and high population densities.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the global **estimated annual mismanaged plastic waste generation** per grid cell. Cells with larger amounts of mismanaged waste are colored red and cells with smaller amounts yellow.

[KEY]

### Please note

* The underlying data on waste generation come from a variety of sources using different methods. Estimates were used where country-level data were incomplete or not available (see below).
* The size of each grid cell varies with latitude. As cells are largest at the equator (~ 0.85 km<sup>2</sup>) and get smaller towards the poles, the same color represents a lower **waste production per km<sup>2</sup>** in equatorial regions than in regions North or South.

## About the study 

The estimates shown were produced as part of a recent study considering multiple future scenarios of plastic waste generation. Plastic waste generation was generated at a local level by combining  

* country-level data on waste management, 
* high-resolution distributions of population,
* high-resolution distributions of gross domestic product (GDP).

The country-level data on waste management include per capita municipal waste generation (available for 160 countries), the estimated percentage of plastic waste (105 countries), and the estimated percentage of mismanaged waste (95 countries), all taken form the "Waste Atlas" ([atlas.d-waste.com](http://www.atlas.d-waste.com/)) where they were submitted by individual experts. Incomplete data were estimated based on statistically significant correlations with GDP (higher GDP correlates with higher waste generation and with lower percentage of mismanaged wate). Global averages were used for countries where no data were available. 

Globally, the study estimates that about about 80 million metric tonnes or 47% of the global annual municipal waste was inadequately disposed.
