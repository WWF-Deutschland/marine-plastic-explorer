  Gyres are large rotating current systems formed by predominant winds and ocean currents. They usually feature lighter winds and currents at their centers where floating plastic is accumulated, resulting in large areas of high plastic concentration.

The most prominent accumulation zone of marine debris is located in the North Pacific Ocean and is commonly referred to as the ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’. However these areas of high concentration are also present at the centers of all other four principal gyres, located in the South Pacific, the North and South Atlantic, as well as the Indian oceans.

The direction of rotation of these large current systems is determined by the Coriolis effect. Currents are deflected to the right in the Northern hemisphere, resulting in a clockwise rotation, while currents in the South are deflected to the left, resulting in an anticlockwise rotation.

## How to read the data

Icons indicate the approximate centers of the five principal gyres, as well as the direction of rotation.
