  Marine plastic pollution has reached crisis levels. It is estimated that more than eight million tonnes of plastic waste enters the world’s oceans every year, threatening marine life, coastal livelihoods and potentially even human health. It is a global problem that urgently requires a global response: It is time to begin negotiations on a new global legally binding agreement.
---

As of today, there is no international treaty in place dedicated to fully tackling this issue. The existing legal framework covering marine plastic pollution is fragmented and ineffective, and does not provide the tools necessary for an effective global response to the problem. This issue cannot be solved on a national or regional level, or through non-binding, voluntary measures alone. It requires coordinated international action, shared responsibility and a common approach.

Discussions on how the international community should respond to the problem have already started, including under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program. WWF is calling on states to use this opportunity to begin negotiations, as soon as possible, on a new international legally binding agreement to tackle marine plastic pollution.

## How to read the data

The visualization shows the level of publicly expressed support by United Nations members states for a new global agreement to address marine plastic pollution. Darker green indicates countries that have officially called for a new agreement; lighter green shows countries that have expressed — including through regional declarations or decisions — a willingness to explore option of a new global agreement; and grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been recorded.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each country is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions (Africa, EU, Caribbean, Nordic countries), regional action plans (Pacific Islands), as well as the Terms of Reference for the Group of Friends in New York.
