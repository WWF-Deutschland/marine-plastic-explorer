  Floating plastics are a significant threat to our marine environment. Many marine species, including seabirds, fish and marine mammals, can become entangled in or ingest plastic debris and absorbed toxic pollutants that accumulate in the global food chains.

Once entering the oceans, floating plastics and other debris are moved by the influence of wind and currents and are slowly broken down into smaller and smaller pieces by their exposure to waves and sunlight. Many of the plastic items remain floating at the surface, however plastic has also been documented throughout the water column, with a significant portion sinking to the bottom of the sea, including in the Mariana Trench at 11,000 meters below sea level.

Here we only show plastic pollution estimated to be floating on the surface. While some debris ends up stranded on coastlines, much of it is being transported and slowly pushed towards the centers of large rotating systems called gyres. Featuring lighter winds and currents, the movements of the floating trash are slowed down resulting in large areas of high plastic concentration. In addition, other areas of high concentration can be observed close to river mouths and in poorly connected marginal seas like the Mediterranean Sea.

### How to read the data

The visualisation shows the estimated concentration of floating plastic waste by weight and per km<sup>2</sup>. Darker colours indicate areas of higher plastic concentration, lighter areas mean lower concentration.

### Please beware

* Study estimates are conservative, thus are best considered to be minimum estimates
* The accumulated trash does not form patches (or even solid islands) as it is often portrayed in popular media. Instead the often tiny particles, mostly measuring 1 mm and less, are better to be understood as a plastic smog that is omnipresent and thicker in the centre of the gyres.


### About the study

The plastic concentration estimates are based on numerical modelling that simulated and tracked virtual particles using 30 years of ocean current and wind data for multiple input scenarios and calibrated the model results using the survey data from 24 expeditions that collected data for four different size classes. You can further explore the survey data in the interactive [Sailing Seas of Plastic](http://app.dumpark.com/seas-of-plastic-2/).
