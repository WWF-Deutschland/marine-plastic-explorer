  Mismanaged plastic waste entering our environment is a growing global concern. Wind and rain carry it into our rivers and out to sea where it endangers wildlife and can accumulate in the food chain.

Plastic waste escaping into the environment can be the result of personal littering, illegal dumping, as well as poorly designed waste management systems and is assumed to be highest in areas of poor waste management and high population densities.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the global **estimated annual mismanaged plastic waste generation** per km<sup>2</sup>. The darker the colour the higher is the estimated amount of mismanaged waste. Lighter areas indicate smaller amounts and often correspond to areas of low population density.

### Please beware

* The underlying data on waste generation come from a variety of sources using different methods. The study used estimates where country-level data were incomplete or not available (see below).
* Combining the country-level data with population densities, the estimates shown here can vary greatly within each country. As a result the apparent lack of estimated mismanaged waste - as can for example be observed in vast parts of Australia and the world’s deserts - does not indicate the absence of data but rather the absence of people.
* The model estimates were provided in kg per cell (30 by 30 arc seconds grid) where the size of each cell varies with latitude (cells are largest at the equator (~ 0.85 km2) and get smaller towards the poles). To account for these differences and the resulting distortion, the data shown in this visualisation has been converted to kg per km<sup>2</sup>.

## About the study

The estimates shown were produced as part of a recent study considering multiple future scenarios of plastic waste generation. The estimates were generated at a local level by combining

* country-level data on waste management,
* high-resolution distributions of population,
* high-resolution distributions of gross domestic product (GDP).

The country-level data on waste management include per capita municipal waste generation (available for 160 countries), the estimated percentage of plastic waste (105 countries), and the estimated percentage of mismanaged waste (95 countries), all taken from the “Waste Atlas” ([atlas.d-waste.com](http://www.atlas.d-waste.com/)) where they were submitted by individual experts. Incomplete data were estimated based on statistically significant correlations with GDP (higher GDP correlates with higher waste generation and with lower percentage of mismanaged waste). Global averages were used for countries where no data were available.

Globally, the study estimates that about 80 million metric tonnes or 47% of the global annual municipal waste were inadequately disposed of.
