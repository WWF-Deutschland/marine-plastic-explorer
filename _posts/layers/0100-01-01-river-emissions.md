  With wind and rain carrying much of the inadequately disposed waste into our freshwater systems, rivers are considered a major source of marine plastic pollution.

In addition to a river catchmentâ€™s size, other factors that have been suggested to influence the amount of trash each river releases into our oceans include population density, levels of urbanisation and industrialisation, rainfall rates as well as the presence of artificial barriers like dams.

It is estimated that all rivers combined emit between 1.2 and 2.4 million tonnes of plastic waste into our oceans every year, with the top 20 polluting rivers being responsible for 66% and the top 122 rivers for more than 90% of the global total.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the estimated top XXX polluting rivers where each river is represented by a circle that is proportionate to its annual rate of pollution. Larger circles thus represent rivers estimated to contribute larger amounts of plastic.

Please (zoom in and) click on the individual circles to see each rivers' estimated annual contribution

### Please beware

* Other land-based inputs include direct littering on our coasts (carried into the oceans by winds and tides) as well as debris being occasionally washed into the ocean by natural disasters such as tsunamis. Together, land-based sources are estimated to make up roughly 80% of all marine litter, with the reminder originating from marine activities such as fishing, shipping and cruises.


## About the study

The estimates shown are the results of a 2017 study that modelled monthly river inputs based on 

* population density
* mismanaged plastic waste,
* monthly catchment runoff, as well as
* the presence of artificial barriers (that prevent plastic from reaching the sea).

Calibrated against real-world measurements, the study estimates an annual contribution between 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes.

Further, looking at seasonal distributions, it is estimated that more than 75% of all river plastic inputs occur between the months of May and October, largely driven by the East Asian monsoon.
