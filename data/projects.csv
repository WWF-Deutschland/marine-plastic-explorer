1,Ghostnets,Geisternetze,"Lost fishing gear is one of the most harmful, and most common, types of marine litter. WWF Germany developed a methodology to locate lost fishing gear and retrieve ghost gear in environmentally friendly way. Sonar technology helps to scan the seafloor without impact, and retrieval with professional divers and cranes is crucial for safety. In 2019, WWF Germany developed the ""Ghostdiver App"" where sports divers can report lost fishing gear they encounter at sea. This methodology was presented to state authorities of the German coastal states to foster political implementation and regular retrievals of lost fishing gear at the German Baltic Coast. __ WWF Germany searches for lost fishing gear around the island of Rügen in Mecklenburg-Western Pommerania, the Bays of Kiel and Lübeck in Schleswig-Holstein, and will start lost gear searches in the German North Sea in 2021.

2,Circular Plastics Economy ,,"WWF works with stakeholders across the plastics value chain in South Africa to ensure that plastic is produced and used in a sustainable manner to ensure both environmental and human health. WWF works to accelerate the transition from the inefficient and wasteful linear economy to a circular economy for plastics in South Africa, in which virgin plastic consumption is reduced, the value of plastic is retained in the economy for as long as possible, and no plastic leaks into nature, resulting in multiple environmental and socio-economic benefits. __ We do this by: __ - Supporting the development and implementation of effective national policy and regulations according to circular economy principles, specifically the mandatory extended producer responsibility for plastic waste; __ - Advocating for a new global treaty to address plastic pollution; __ - Shifting market practices to reduce virgin plastic consumption and move towards a circular plastic economy through product innovation for reuse, recycling and new product delivery models; __ - Conducting research to support global best practices for product and packaging design, certification and labelling  guidelines; and __ - Sharing our learnings with local and regional partners.",,https://www.wwf.org.za/our_work/initiatives/the_circular_plastics_economy.cfm,,Lorren de Kock (WWF South Africa)
3,Marine Litter-Free Porto Santo,,The objetive of the project is to establish a foundation for a thorough understanding of the plastic ecosystem of Porto Santo Island by: __ - identifying flow and disposal of waste; __ - optimizing waste management; __ - and drastically reducing consumption of single use plastics,,,,Catarina Grilo (ANP|WWF Portugal)
4,Solutions and alternatives to single-use plastics,,"Single-use plastics are the most common form of marine litter in Australia. To transition away from single-use plastics, WWF-Australia is working on a project that highlights sustainable solutions and policy levers for governments to address the most problematic single-use plastics.",,,,Katinka Day (WWF - Australia)
5,Extended Producer Responsibility,,"Material flow analyses completed for 7 plastic types for Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand (and soon Vietnam). __ Overall focus countries: India, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam (and soon Kenya, South Africa and India) __ Coordinated from WWF Berlin office",,https://wwf.panda.org/?356332/Extended-Producer-Responsibility-Project,,Xin (Vivian) Chen (WWF Germany)
6,Lost Fishing Gear,,"The effort was to test if we could retrieve nets from the fjord and recycle/reuse the plastic. We worked with the local government to ship nets to Plastix in Denmark, where the nets were recycled into new, green plastic products. We have two small films illustrating the project: __ - https://we.tl/t-RXeLySGzdh __ - https://youtu.be/Tp7OBUtUpyM",,,,Kaare Winther (WWF Denmark)
7,Plastic Smart Cities,,WWF invites cities to commit to ambitious plastic pollution targets in line with WWF’s No Plastic in Nature vision and to develop and disseminate Plastic Smart Action best practices.,,http://www.plasticsmartcities.org/,,
8,PACT,,"Plastic ACTion (PACT) is a business initiative, by WWF-Singapore, which aims to eliminate plastic pollution in nature and ultimately move towards a circular economy on plastics. __ We engage with businesses via sectoral collaborations, or individual company commitments. __ under sectoral collaborations, companies engage in pre-competitive actions to reduce plastic use on an industry-wide scale. __ Under individual company commitments, companies sign time-bound, numerical commitments to reduce their plastic usage. __ PACT also provides resources and tools for businesses, such as the Alternative Materials Tool (AMT). The AMT is a webtool for procurement teams of F&B & Hospitality industries, to guide them on selecting the single-use packaging material with the least environmental impacts.",,http://plastic-action.asia/,,Stefanie Beitien (WWF Singapore)
10,Princes' Islands Zero Waste Pilot Project (2019-2021),,"In alignment with WWF Marine Mediterranean Initiative (MMI), WWF-Turkey is implementing a 3-year project at the Princes' Islands of Istanbul-Turkey, advocating to governments, working with industry, engaging with municipalities and mobilizing people to ensure no more plastic enters the sea by 2030. This project seeks to implement communication activities at the local and national level aimed at raising awareness on plastic pollution and thus mobilize the society towards the reduction of single use plastics consumption.",,http://zerowaste.gov.tr/,,
11,Plastic Hunters (2020-2021),,"The project implemented by WWF-Turkey and Brand Conference, aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated and increase the recycling rate of plastics at the districts of Besiktas and Üsküdar (two of the biggest central sub-provinces), Istanbul with the support of Brand Conference.",,http://www.markaconference.com/plastikavcilari,,
12,Marine Litter & Waste Atlas and Litterati (2018-2020),,"WWF-Turkey’s Marine Litter project aimed to take a general picture of the marine litter problem along the coastline of Turkey, following the methodology of ACT4LITTER IntteregMed project. The objective of the projects were identification of potential measures to address marine litter issues; development of action plans for preventing and mitigating marine litter through a participatory approach; feasibility assessment of the identified measures to be implemented through the development of an appropriate decision-making model. Litterati is an app that is empowering individuals to make a significant, measurable impact on the environment via implementing Citizen Science. Far more than just picking up litter, the worldwide community of Litterati users are building the most powerful crowd-sourced set of data on litter ever assembled.",,https://www.wwf.org.tr/calismalarimiz/oceans/deniz_ky_temizlii,,
13,Danida Market Development Partnership (DMDP) Waste to Value Project,,"From Waste to Value: Tapping the market for recycled plastic in Kenya. __ An innovative partnership between WWF-Kenya & WWF Denmark and three pioneering private sector plastics recycling agents – Plastix, Jil plastics and Kwale Plastic Plus Collectors (KPPC) to combat the challenges of plastic pollution and generate economic growth. The aim of the partnership is to transform plastic waste otherwise discarded in the natural environment into a valuable commodity and promote a circular plastic economy. The project will work towards establishing an international plastic recycling value chain building on sustainable practices by connecting collectors, sorters and processors to high-end and innovative plastic recycling expertise and technology. The partnership agents have been put together to complement each other with different knowledge, networks and skills to the project. As the project develops and expands, the goal is to include more partners along the value chain. The partnership strives to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals by improving livelihoods for women, men and especially youth, by formalizing, improving logistics and skills around the business case on collecting, sorting and processing plastic waste in Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi and Lamu counties along the coast of Kenya. The market development partnership also seeks to entrench a culture of responsible business conduct and sustainable practices, supported by the local community and authorities among entrepreneurs.",,https://dmdp.dk/projects/waste-to-value-tapping-the-market-for-recycle-plastic-in-kenya/,,Alex Kubasu
