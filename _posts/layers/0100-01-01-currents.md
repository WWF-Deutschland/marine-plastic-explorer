  Driven by global wind systems, ocean surface currents are an important factor for determining the movements and fate of marine plastic pollution.
---

The continuous movements of the surface water (up to a depth of 400m) are mainly caused by large-scale winds, but waves and differences in temperature and salinity also play a role.

Another factor is the Coriolis effect -a result of the Earth’s rotation- that is responsible for the direction the current systems rotate: while currents in the Northern hemisphere rotate in a clockwise direction, they rotate anticlockwise in the South.

## How to read the data

Arrows indicate the direction and approximate location of the world’s predominant currents.
