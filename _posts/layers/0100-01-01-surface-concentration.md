  The plastic floating in our oceans is a significant threat to our marine ecosystems. Seabirds, fish and marine mammals can become entangled in or ingest plastic debris, and as a result toxic pollutants can accumulate in the food chains. In addition to its environmental impacts, floating plastic can also adversely affect our economy, specifically the tourism and fisheries sectors.

Once entering the oceans, floating plastics and other debris are moved by wind and currents and slowly broken down into smaller and smaller pieces by their exposure to waves and sunlight.

While much of the debris stays in coastal waters and ends up stranded on beaches and coastlines, some of it is being transported offshore by winds and currents and commonly ends up in one of the five principal gyres. These are large rotating systems that slowly move the floating debris towards their centers, resulting in large areas of high plastic concentration. In addition, other areas of high concentration can be observed close to river mouths and in poorly connected marginal seas like the Mediterranean Sea.

### How to read the data

The map layer shows the **estimated concentration of floating plastic** by weight and per km<sup>2</sup>, specifically for plastic items measuring 0.33 mm and more. The darker the colour, the higher is the estimated concentration of floating plastic.

#### Please beware

* This study is only concerned with **floating plastic** and does not consider the significant portion of plastic items that sinks. Plastic pollution has been documented throughout the water column, including at the bottom of the worldâ€™s deepest trench at 11,000 meters below sea level.
* Due to limitations of the data collection method, this study only included plastic items of a **minimum size of 0.33 mm** and thus does not account for any smaller plastic pieces. Further, subsequent analysis using aerial imagery indicates that the data collected also appears to have underestimated the presence of the larger Macroplastics with a size of 200 mm and above
* The modelled estimates are conservative and are thus best considered to be minimum estimates.
* The accumulating trash does not form solid garbage patches (or even solid islands) as it is often portrayed in popular media. Instead, the plastic pollution can be better understood as an omnipresent plastic soup that contains varying concentrations of independently floating plastic items of all types and sizes.
* While the original model estimates were made available for each of the four size classes, this visualisation shows the aggregated values for all classes.

### About the study

The plastic concentration estimates are based on numerical modelling that simulated and tracked virtual particles using 30 years of ocean current and wind data for multiple input scenarios. **The study estimated a global total of 5.25 trillion floating plastic pieces together weighing over 268,000 tons**.

The model results were calibrated using survey data from 24 expeditions that collected data for four different size classes:
* microplastics with a size between 0.33 and 1 mm
* microplastics with a size between 1 and 4.75 mm
* mesoplastics with a size between 4.75 and 200 mm
* macroplastics larger than 200 mm.
