  Floating plastics are a significant threat to our marine environment as they
  are ingested by many species and also absorb toxic pollutants that accumulate
  in the global food chains.

Once entering the oceans, floating plastics and other debris are moved by the influence of wind and ocean currents and over the years break down into smaller and smaller pieces.

With the predominant winds and currents forming large rotating systems called gyres, the floating trash is transported along and slowly pushed to their centers where their migration slows down significantly due to the prevailing light winds and currents, resulting in large areas of high plastic concentration. While the most prominent accumulation zone is located in the North Pacific Ocean (commonly referred to as the 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch'), the other principal gyres are present in the South Pacific, the North and South Atlantic, as well as the Indian oceans.

In addition, other areas of high concentration can be observed close to river mouths and in poorly connected marginal seas like the Mediterranean Sea.

### How to read the data

The visualisation shows the estimated concentration of floating plastic waste by weight and per km<sup>2</sup>. Darker areas indicate areas of higher plastic concentration, lighter areas mean lower concentration.

### Please beware

* The accumulated trash does not form patches (or even solid islands) as it is often portrayed in popular media, but instead the often tiny particles, mostly measuring 1 mm and less, are better to be understood as a plastic smog that is omnipresent and thicker in the centre of the gyres.

### About the study

The plastic concentration estimates are based on numerical modelling that simulated and tracked virtual particles using 30 years of ocean current and wind data for multiple input scenarios and calibrated the model results using the survey data from 24 expeditions that collected data for four different size classes.
